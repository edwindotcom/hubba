Hubba is a Chrome/Edge extension to make browsing and searching GitHub easier. We don't bookmark as much as we used to and this extension puts common web links two clicks away.

## Installation

#### Webstore


#### Local install

* open a terminal and run:
```
git clone
cd hubba
yarn
yarn run build
```
* In Edge/Chrome goto chrome://extensions
* toggle `Developer Mode`
* click `load unpacked extension`
* browse to the `/build` of this cloned repo
* look in tool tray for cat icon in browser
